# Yggdrasil — Context Refresh Protocol

## STOP. Read this before writing any code.

You are working on a multi-app Tauri 2.x desktop platform with shared Rust core crates and Svelte 5 frontends. You have context from a compaction summary or from earlier in this session. **You are almost certainly wrong about the details.**

After compaction, you have app names and a workspace shape but lose the core/shell boundary, the command prefix system, the vite alias conventions, and the ways this project's architecture diverges from standard Tauri/Svelte patterns. You will produce output that looks right, compiles, and silently breaks the unified shell because the summary told you WHAT but not HOW or WHY NOT.

**This has happened before.** Previous sessions in this project have:

- Used `$lib/` imports inside view components — breaks when the component is imported via Vite alias from another app's source tree
- Added Tauri dependencies to core crates — core crates are pure Rust logic with zero Tauri dependency
- Forgot command prefixes in the unified shell — each app's commands need 4-letter prefixes (hlid_, sval_, kvas_, rata_) when hosted in Yggdrasil
- Tried to `git add` files under `src/lib/` without `-f` — the global gitignore at `~/.config/git/ignore` excludes `lib/`

None of them felt uncertain while doing it.

**The test:** Can you name the four command prefixes, explain why view components use `./` imports instead of `$lib/`, and state what the `commands` prop does on each view? If not, read PLAN_UNIFIED_SHELL.md before proceeding.

## You Will Get These Things Wrong

### Using $lib/ Imports in View Components
**Detection:** If you find `$lib/` in an import path inside a component that lives in an app's `src/lib/` directory...
**Why it's wrong:** View components are consumed by two different apps: their standalone app (where `$lib` resolves to their own `src/lib/`) and the Yggdrasil unified shell (where `$lib` resolves to Yggdrasil's `src/lib/`). Using `$lib/` means the import works standalone but breaks in the unified shell.
**Recovery:** Use `./` relative imports for sibling components. The view component must be self-contained within its own directory.

### Adding Tauri Dependencies to Core Crates
**Detection:** If you find `tauri` in any `core/*/Cargo.toml` dependency list...
**Why it's wrong:** Core crates (`hlidskjalf_core`, `svalinn_core`, `kvasir_core`, `ratatoskr_core`) are pure Rust logic — parsing, classification, data structures, business rules. They must compile without Tauri. The Tauri crate (e.g., `hlidskjalf/src-tauri/`) is a thin shell that wraps core functions as `#[tauri::command]` handlers. This separation lets core logic be tested, reused, and reasoned about independently.
**Recovery:** Put the logic in the core crate, put the `#[tauri::command]` wrapper in the Tauri crate's `lib.rs`.

### Forgetting Command Prefixes in Unified Shell
**Detection:** If you find a Tauri command registration in Yggdrasil's `lib.rs` without a 4-letter prefix...
**Why it's wrong:** Each standalone app registers commands with bare names (`start_monitor`, `speak`). Yggdrasil hosts all four apps in one process — command names must be globally unique. The convention is 4-letter prefixes: `hlid_start_monitor`, `sval_scan_directory`, `kvas_list_directory`, `rata_load_graph`. View components receive a `commands` prop that maps bare names to prefixed names.
**Recovery:** Read PLAN_UNIFIED_SHELL.md "Command Naming Convention" section.

### Confusing the Datagram Schema with HookEvent
**Detection:** If you find `HookEvent` fields on a datagram struct, or datagram fields on a hook event handler...
**Why it's wrong:** The canonical `Datagram` struct lives in nornir's `datagram` crate with typed `DatagramKind` and `Priority` enums. `hlidskjalf_core` re-exports these types. The legacy `HookEvent` format is backward-compatible but deprecated. New code should emit and consume `Datagram` with enum variants, not strings. The Tauri event name is `"datagram"` (not the old `"hook-event"`).
**Recovery:** Read HLIDSKJALF_DATAGRAM.md and `schemas/datagram.schema.json`. Check nornir `datagram/src/lib.rs` for the canonical struct.

### Putting Display Logic in Core Crates
**Detection:** If you find HTML, CSS, component references, or frontend formatting in a `*_core` crate...
**Why it's wrong:** Core crates produce typed data. The Svelte frontend decides how to display it. The boundary is: core returns structured data, frontend renders it. If you need to format something for display, that's a Svelte concern.
**Recovery:** Return the raw data from the core crate. Write a Svelte component to render it.

### Editing Shared UI Components Without Checking All Consumers
**Detection:** If you modify a component in `ui/` without checking which apps import it...
**Why it's wrong:** The `ui/` directory is a shared component library consumed by all 5 apps. A change to `SidebarLayout.svelte` affects every app that uses it. CSS token changes propagate everywhere.
**Recovery:** Grep for the component name across all app `src/` directories before modifying.

### Adding App Logic to Yggdrasil Instead of the App
**Detection:** If you find app-specific state, behavior, event handling, or UI logic in `yggdrasil/src/` that isn't tab switching or command name mapping...
**Why it's wrong:** Yggdrasil is a thin host — it imports views, maps command names with 4-letter prefixes, and renders a tab strip. That's it. Each app (Hlidskjalf, Svalinn, Kvasir, Ratatoskr) must work identically whether run standalone or inside Yggdrasil. If you add behavior to Yggdrasil, the standalone app diverges silently. This is the most common LLM drift pattern: grep from workspace root, find the view imported in `yggdrasil/src/routes/+page.svelte`, and start editing there instead of in the app's own `src/lib/`.
**Recovery:** Ask: "Would this change affect the app when run standalone?" If yes, it belongs in the app's own source tree (`hlidskjalf/src/lib/`, `svalinn/src/lib/`, etc.), not in Yggdrasil. The only files in Yggdrasil that should ever change are `+page.svelte` (tab strip), `vite.config.js` (aliases), and `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (prefixed command registration).

## Quick Orientation

**What is this?** A unified introspection platform — 5 Tauri 2.x desktop apps sharing one Cargo workspace, all with Svelte 5 frontends. Norse mythology naming throughout.

**What pattern does it follow?** Core/shell separation: pure Rust logic in `core/*_core/` crates, thin Tauri command wrappers in `*/src-tauri/`, Svelte 5 views in `*/src/lib/`. Yggdrasil unifies all four views via Vite aliases, command prefixing, and a `commands` prop contract.

**Where is the plan?** `PLAN_UNIFIED_SHELL.md` for architecture. `DISPLAY_AND_FILTERING.md` and `NEURODIVERGENT_MODALITIES.md` for the Bifrost integration and alert system design.

**What is the current phase?** Core infrastructure exists for all 5 apps. Hlidskjalf has a working event feed with datagram rendering. Active work: integrating Bifrost exchange diffs into Hlidskjalf display, building the multi-modal alert system, and adding session-aware filtering.

## You Will Get These Things Wrong (salvaged)

### Looking Everywhere But the Setting When a Restriction Is Reported
**Detection:** The user says a restriction exists ("we set it so Kvasir can only browse `~/ai/`", "there's a limit on Z") and you start searching for errors, Tauri scopes, capabilities, or entitlements, or you speculate that the restriction doesn't exist.
**Why it's wrong:** The restriction does exist — the user put it there. Kvasir's path restriction, for example, is enforced in the shared `ContainerLayout.svelte` (`cwdRoot`, `isWithinBoundary`), NOT in Tauri scopes/capabilities/entitlements or app-specific Rust. Chasing the wrong layer cost many rounds and forced the user to escalate repeatedly.
**Recovery:** FIND THE SETTING FIRST. Grep broadly for the restricted path/value across ALL source files — including shared UI components like `ContainerLayout.svelte` — before investigating any other cause.

## Project Notes (salvaged)

### Build / Deploy Procedure
- Iterating on one app? Build just that app: `cd <app> && npm run tauri build`. Do NOT rebuild the whole ecosystem for a small change.
- Deploying a Tauri app: kill the running app, clear WebKit caches, then copy the `.app` to `/Applications`. `deploy_apps.sh` does this; the kill + cache-clear steps matter because the old process holds the old binary and WKWebView caches stale frontend.

### Out-of-Repo Operational Infrastructure
The datagram transport depends on system services installed OUTSIDE this repo (not discoverable from the source tree):
- **record_datagrams daemon** — `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.smidja.record-datagrams.plist` (KeepAlive, RunAtLoad). Persists the daily datagram archive via the Unix stream channel.
- **Loopback MTU** — `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.smidja.loopback-mtu.plist` raises `lo0` MTU to 65535 at boot (needs sudo). Required so large UDP-multicast datagrams (e.g. quality reports with many groups) are not silently dropped on loopback.
